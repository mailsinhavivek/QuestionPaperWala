1. Domain & Routing Issues

Accessing questionpaper.replit.app originally returned a blank “Not Found” page, while the content is available at questionpaper‑ai.replit.app. Broken or duplicate domains confuse users and hurt search rankings. Use a single canonical domain and set up 301 redirects so visitors and search engines are always sent to the correct site.

When scrolling, I unintentionally landed on another “Not Found” page, suggesting a hidden route is bound to scroll events. Review the front‑end routing logic to ensure the scroll wheel doesn’t trigger navigation events.

2. Navigation & Calls to Action

The hero section prominently features the product name and a gradient background, but the only visible navigation links are “Sign In” and “Signup”
questionpaper.replit.app
. Potential users don’t know how to generate a paper or use the problem‑solver unless they scroll and read the fine‑print “Quick Access” links. Adding a persistent top navigation bar with links to “Generate Paper”, “Problem Solver”, “Pricing” and “How It Works” would improve orientation.

Multiple CTAs appear on one page—“Try FREE Now”, “Start Studying Now” and “Start Creating Now”
questionpaper.replit.app
—which can be confusing. Consolidate these actions into a single primary CTA (e.g., “Generate Your First Paper Free”) and place secondary actions elsewhere.

The pricing section shows a “Coming Soon” subscription card alongside the free plan
questionpaper.replit.app
. If a paid plan is not yet available, consider collecting emails for a waitlist and clearly stating the launch timeline rather than presenting a full pricing table.

3. Content & Messaging

The SEO meta description emphasises support for CBSE, ICSE, Maharashtra Board and 33+ curricula with instant answers
questionpaper.replit.app
. However, the landing page copy doesn’t highlight these differentiators until far down the page. Bring the key value propositions (multi‑board support, instant solutions, 10‑language availability
questionpaper.replit.app
) higher in the hero section to capture attention.

Sections for students, teachers and parents clearly outline benefits
questionpaper.replit.app
, yet including a short demo or a sample question paper would let users experience the product before signing up.

The testimonial section contains a single quote. Rotating testimonials from multiple parents and teachers along with user ratings (e.g., the 4.9‑star rating mentioned in structured data
questionpaper.replit.app
) can build more trust.

4. Accessibility & UI Improvements

Some text (e.g., light blue text on blue backgrounds) has low contrast
questionpaper.replit.app
. Use WCAG‑compliant color contrasts and provide ample whitespace to improve readability.

Ensure all images have descriptive alt attributes and form fields have labels to aid screen‑reader users; the view source didn’t show any alt tags because images are injected via scripts.

Mobile responsiveness is good, but the large images and gradients slow down initial loading. Compress images, lazy‑load below‑the‑fold assets, and minify JavaScript to improve performance.

5. User On‑boarding & Authentication

Clicking “Start Creating Now” leads directly to a sign‑in form requiring email or phone and password
questionpaper.replit.app
. For first‑time users, offer social login options (Google, Apple) and a clearer sign‑up flow.

Clarify password requirements and use real‑time validation to improve the sign‑in experience. A “Forgot Password” link is present
questionpaper.replit.app
, which is good, but adding a help tooltip or FAQ link could further reduce support questions.

6. SEO & Structured Data

The page’s metadata includes a canonical link to questionpaper‑ai.replit.app and rich structured data specifying features, ratings and curricula
questionpaper.replit.app
. Ensure that these are kept updated and that the canonical URL matches the domain users see. Adding open‑graph images and alt text to images will enhance sharing on social media.

By addressing broken links, simplifying navigation and CTAs, emphasizing key differentiators earlier, improving accessibility and performance, and refining the sign‑up flow, the site will provide a smoother experience for parents, teachers and students while better conveying its value proposition.
